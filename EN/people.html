          <p>Nawal El Saadawi was an Egyptian writer and human rights activist. Originally a doctor and psychiatrist, she wrote about female genital mutilation and more generally about the role of women in Islam and Egyptian society. Her 1972 publication al-Mar'a wa-l-ǧins ("Woman and Sex", first German translation published by Gamila in 2024) led to a publication ban in Egypt and the dismissal of her then position as Director of Health Education at the Egyptian Ministry of Health. Nawaal El Saadawi published numerous novels, short stories, plays, memoirs, essays and political writings. She died in Cairo in March 2021 at the age of 89. [Picture: Bengt Oberger] </p>

        <div class="author_description">
          <p>André Léo (born Victoire Léodile Béra in 1824) was a French writer, journalist and political activist. She wrote numerous novels and stories as well as articles and political writings. In her work, the feminist author dealt with social issues such as the emancipation of women, decent working conditions and the separation of church and state (on the latter topic, see "Schneiden wir das Seil durch!", published by Gamila in 2022). André Léo spent large parts of her life in French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino and cultivated relationships with political and literary figures such as Victor Hugo and Mikhail Bakunin, whose "Alliance internationale de la démocratie socialiste" she joined in 1871. In 1881, Léo returned to France, where she continued to work as a writer and remained politically active for the next two decades. She died in 1900 at the age of 75 in her apartment in Paris.</p>
